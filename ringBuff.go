/*
 * The RingBuffer data structure is used to store information on rounds and updates
 * It functions like a typical Circluar buffer, with some slight modifications
 * First, it is made generic by using interface{} instead of a defined type
 * Second, it requires an id function to be passed in which gets an ID from whatever the underlying object is
 * Finally, it allows for manipulation of data using both normal indeces and ID values as counters
